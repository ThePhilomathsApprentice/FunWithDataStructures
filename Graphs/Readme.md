# Graph Data Structure

## Directed Graphs




## Uni-Directed Graphs



## Cyclic vs Acylcic Graph
```
If we are coming back to the same vertex by following a path, then its a cyclic grpah.
```


## Weighted bs unweighted Graph.
```
Weighted:
every edges has a weight asociated with it, we will say this value as the weight of the edge.

Un-Weighted:
no edges has a weight asociated with it.
```





## Walk vs Path
```
A walk is a path, if the "EDGE" is not repeated.
```
